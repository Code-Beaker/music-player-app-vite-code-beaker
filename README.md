# Music Player using Vanilla HTML, SCSS and JavaScript

This is a solution to the **Music Player** challenge from [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/), coded by Code-Beaker. This is not a functional website and does not make use of any APIs. This is created only for visual interaction.

## Tools and Languages

- Vanilla JavaScript

### Tools
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Process
Here's how I created this app using Vite and npm.

cd app/

npm i

npm add sass -D

npm run dev
```
